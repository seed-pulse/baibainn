# The Baibain Paradox: Can Chestnut Buns Really Fill the Universe?

## Overview

In the world of *Doraemon*, the secret gadget "Baibain" doubles any object every 5 seconds.  
In the episode, Nobita uses it on a chestnut bun, leading to a warning: "If left unchecked, they’ll fill the universe."  
But does this scenario hold up under the laws of physics?

This document introduces a thought experiment called the **Baibain Paradox**, exploring how **thermodynamics** and **kinetic limits** would actually prevent this infinite proliferation.  
We argue that the chestnut buns would **burn out due to their own speed and collisions** before ever filling the cosmos.

## Assumptions

1. Baibain causes **exponential growth**, doubling the object every 5 seconds.
2. The duplicated buns have **mass** and **volume**, occupying physical space.
3. As density increases, **collisions between buns** become inevitable.
4. Collisions generate **heat** and cause physical changes.

## Core Paradox

### 1. Collision-Induced Heat and Self-Destruction

- As buns multiply and move, **kinetic energy** accumulates.
- Collisions convert this energy into **heat**, potentially causing combustion or disintegration.
- Even in vacuum, **thermal runaway** could trigger self-destruction.

### 2. Relativistic Speed Limits

- The spread of buns across space involves **movement**.
- But nothing, including information or matter, can exceed **the speed of light**.
- If the universe expands faster than the buns can spread, they **cannot fill all space**.

### 3. Conservation Laws and Cosmic Constraints

- The **law of energy conservation** applies universally.
- Infinite duplication demands **infinite energy**, which violates physical reality.
- Eventually, the buns would hit a **mass-energy limit** and collapse.

## Conclusion: Chestnut Buns Cannot Fill the Universe

Despite Baibain’s magical premise, the physical universe imposes clear constraints:

- **Thermal self-destruction**
- **Limitations from the expanding universe**
- **Relativistic propagation barriers**
- **Conservation of energy and mass**

Thus, **chestnut buns would burn out before reaching universal saturation**.  
This is what we define as the **Baibain Paradox**.

> Every act of expansion faces a critical breaking point.  
> When the idea of infinity confronts physical reality, the true question becomes:  
> **Can it be sustained?**
