# The Baibain Paradox: Can Chestnut Manju Really Fill the Universe?

## Overview

In the world of *Doraemon*, the secret gadget "Baibain" doubles any object every 5 seconds.  
In the episode, Nobita uses it on a **chestnut manju** — a traditional Japanese steamed sweet filled with chestnut paste — which leads to a warning:  
**"If left unchecked, they'll fill the universe."**

But does this scenario hold up under the laws of physics?

This document introduces a thought experiment called the **Baibain Paradox**, exploring how **thermodynamics** and **kinetic limits** would actually prevent infinite proliferation.  
We argue that the chestnut manju would **burn out due to their own velocity and collisions** before ever filling the cosmos.

## Assumptions

1. Baibain causes **exponential growth**, doubling the object every 5 seconds.
2. The duplicated manju have **mass** and **volume**, and occupy physical space.
3. As density increases, **collisions between manju** become inevitable.
4. Collisions generate **heat**, leading to physical changes or destruction.

## Core Paradox

### 1. Collision-Induced Heat and Self-Destruction

- As manju multiply and move, **kinetic energy** accumulates.
- Collisions convert this energy into **heat**, potentially causing combustion, evaporation, or fragmentation.
- Even in a vacuum, **thermal runaway** could trigger the breakdown of manju.

### 2. Relativistic Speed Limits

- The spread of manju across space involves **motion**.
- But nothing, including information or matter, can exceed **the speed of light**.
- If the universe is expanding faster than the manju can spread, they **cannot fill all space**.

### 3. Conservation Laws and Cosmic Constraints

- The **law of conservation of energy** applies universally.
- Infinite duplication would require **infinite energy**, which violates known physical laws.
- Eventually, the manju would reach a **mass-energy threshold** and collapse or combust.

## Conclusion: Chestnut Manju Cannot Fill the Universe

Despite Baibain’s magical mechanism, the physical universe imposes firm constraints:

- **Thermal self-destruction**
- **Limitations imposed by universal expansion**
- **Relativistic motion barriers**
- **Conservation of energy and mass**

Thus, **chestnut manju would burn out before achieving cosmic saturation**.  
This contradiction is what we refer to as the **Baibain Paradox**.
